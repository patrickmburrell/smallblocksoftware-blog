Over the past several years, I've tried to get a blog going using a few different platforms: [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com), [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com), [WordPress](https://wordpress.com), and [Ghost](https://ghost.org). For one reason or another - I'm sure mostly my lack of commitment - I never stuck with any of them.

But "hope springs eternal," so I am starting again. This time I'm using [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/blog/) to build a static site blog; I'm hosting it on [GitHib Pages](https://pages.github.com).

I've been using Python almost exclusively the last year as the DevOps person on my data science team at work. (Before that, my predominant use of JavaScript led me to try Ghost.) I like the idea of using a static site for a blog because my needs will be simple and straightforward. Also, I'm a huge fan of Markdown, so Nikola holds interesting and fun potential.
