Over the past few years, I've tried to get a blog going using a few different platforms: (Squarespace)[https://www.squarespace.com], (Tumblr)[https://www.tumblr.com], (WordPress)[https://wordpress.com], and (Ghost)[https://ghost.org]. For one reason or another - I'm sure mostly lack of my commitment - I've never stuck with any of them. But "hope springs eternal" so I am starting again. This time I'm using (Nikola)[https://getnikola.com/blog/] to build a static site blog and hosting it on (GitHib Pages)[https://pages.github.com].

I've been using Python almost exclusively the last year as the DevOps person on my data science team at work. (Before that, my predominant use of JavaScript led me to try Ghost.) I like the idea of using a static site for a blog because my needs will be simple and straightforward. Also, I'm a huge fan of Markdown, so Nikola held exciting and fun potential.
