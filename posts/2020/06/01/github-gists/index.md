I finally took a few minutes to learn what gists are in GitHub. I understood the basic idea from encountering them all over the web, but I wanted to precisely know what they are.

Here are some essential aspects of gists, as I understand them:

-   each gist is a repository, with all that implies:
    -   can be versioned and diff’ed
    -   can be forked or cloned
-   a gist can be public or secret
    -   secret doesn’t mean private; it means not searchable
    -   however, its URL is discoverable and shareable
-   a gist can contain anything text-based, such as:
    -   source code
    -   Markdown and plain text
    -   JSON, XML, and CSV data
    -   Jupyter Notebooks
    -   GeoJSON files (maps!)
-   more info: [About gists](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-gists#about-gists)

My recent motivation for learning to use gists was to embed sample code on this blog, like this:

.. gist:: 9e26a4f1d0b29d98436c06051e747035

Pretty convenient and simple!
